    <h4>Global Positioning Systems, better known as GPS, has become an integral part of everyday life. From how we move
        from place to place to how we defend our borders, GPS can be used to enhance our directional accuracy
        considerably.
        <br>
        These days, locating an establishment you’ve never been to is as easy as asking your phone for directions. GPS
        makes this seemingly small action possible, the same ways it allows the military to launch accurate missile
        strikes on targets that are continents away from their base.
        <br>
        GPS is one of those technologies that crept up on everyone and entwined itself with other useful technologies to
        become invaluable in our ever-growing world. To fully understand just how vital GPS is in the modern world, it
        is necessary to see just what this technology, in its entire expedience, helps us achieve in different area</h4>

    <h4>When it comes to choosing a laptop there are many things to consider, especially when it comes to new
        technology. The upcoming Macbook Pro 2021 feautures a 6- and 8-core CPUs and up to 64GB RAM, and GPUs that offer
        up to 2.1 times faster graphics performance than the previous standard configuration. Apple is claiming this is
        the first notebook in the world to offer an 8 TB option for internal storage. As standard, it now comes with
        512GB SSD — double the previous generation. With the release of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple discontinued the
        older 15-inch model. </h4>

        <p>How the Internet Works</p>
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    <h4> According to <i>Simple English Wiki</i>, the Internet is the biggest world-wide communication network of
        computers. The Internet has millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, which
        together carry many different kinds of information. The short form of internet is the 'net'. The World Wide Web
        is one of its biggest services. It is used by billions of people all over the world.
        Logo of DARPA, an organization funded by the US government, which helped develop the Internet
        The Internet was developed in the United States by the "United States Department of Defense Advanced Research
        Projects Agency" (DARPA). The Internet was first connected in October of 1969 and was called ARPANET. The World
        Wide Web was created at CERN in Switzerland in 1990 by a British (UK) scientist named Tim Berners-Lee.
        Today, people can pay money to access the Internet from internet service providers. Some services on the
        Internet cost nothing to use. Sometimes people who offer these free services use advertising to make money.
        Censorship and freedom of speech on the Internet can be controversial.</h4>

    <H1>5 Components of a Computer</H1>
    <br>
    <h3>
        <p>ISP</p>
    </h3>
    <ul>Stands for Internet Service Provider</ul>
    <ul>ISPs are companies that provide internet service to customers for a fee</ul>
    <ul>Some examples of ISPs are: Xfinity, CenturyLink, AT&T, etc.</ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>
        <p>IP Address</p>
    </h3>
    <ul>Stands for Internet Protocol Address</ul>
    <ul>It is a unique numerical address that identifies a device or a local network.</ul>
    <ul>IP addresses provide a way for the internet to differentiate between computers, routers, and websites</ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>
        <p>ALU</p>
    </h3>
    <ul>Stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit </ul>
    <ul>An arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) is the part of a computer processor (CPU) that carries out arithmetic and logic
        operations on the operands in computer instruction words</ul>
    <ul>Mathematician John von Neumann proposed the ALU concept in 1945 in a report on the foundations for a new
        computer called the EDVAC</ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>
        <p>Control Unit</p>
    </h3>
    <ul>The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs the operation of
        the processor.</ul>
    <ul>It is the "brain within the brain", as it controls what happens inside the processor, which in turn controls the
        rest of the compute</ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>
        <p>CPU</p>
    </h3>
    <ul>Stands for Central Processing Unit</ul>
    <ul>is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program.</ul>
    <ul>The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output operations specified by the instructions
        in the program</ul>
